Hardware
L432KC or similar with PWM capable outputs.
The L432KC pin D13 for onboard LED is not PWM capable!
LEDs and xxx Ohm resistor. For example for a 12 V supply,
three LEDs in series select a 120 Ohm resistor for 20 mA LEDs. 
For testing 3 pieces MOSFET IRL540, LEDs, resistors. 

PWM example for students to work with a MOSFET circuit.
